# Hotel Revenue Management System  
### Group Presentation

## 📌 Overview
This group presentation focuses on the design and analysis of a **Hotel Revenue Management System** built using Power BI.  
The project analyzes booking, customer, room, and service data to improve **occupancy, pricing, and overall revenue performance** using industry-standard KPIs and interactive dashboards.

A **star schema data model** forms the backbone of the system, enabling accurate calculation of **Occupancy Rate, Average Daily Rate (ADR), and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)**, along with guest segmentation, forecasting, and revenue strategy analysis.
